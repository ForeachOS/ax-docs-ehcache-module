= 2.x.x release notes

[#2-0-0]
== 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT

This release requires Across 5.0.0.

=== Extension module
EhcacheModule configuration has been modified to extend the AcrossContextInfrastructureModule configuration.
It no longer starts its own `ApplicationContext`.

Most applications should have no effect from this, but any code directly accessing the EhcacheModule bean factory would now fail.

Module configurations added to EhcacheModule should be added to AcrossContextInfrastructureModule instead.

=== Changelist
* debug web support has been updated:
** the navigation section has been changed from _Cache overview_ to _Cache browser / Ehcache_
** support for `EhCacheCache` details has been added to the default _Cache browser_
*** events of type `DebugCacheStatistics<EhCacheCache>` are handled by EhcacheModule
* the `@EnableCaching` module configuration is now injected as optional configuration in other modules, no longer forcing an `ApplicationContext` bootstrap
